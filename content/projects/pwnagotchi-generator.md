Testing distributed systems is hard. But what if the system you need to test has no official documentation? That's where reverse engineering comes in. The **Pwnagotchi Generator** started as a deep dive into understanding how opwngrid's authentication and reporting protocols work under the hood.

## The Challenge: Understanding opwngrid

The Pwnagotchi ecosystem relies on opwngrid to share captured WiFi handshakes across devices. But to build effective testing tools, I needed to understand:

- How does authentication actually work?
- What cryptographic signing scheme is used?
- How are access points reported and validated?
- What rate limiting or anti-abuse mechanisms exist?
- Can the protocol handle extreme edge cases?

The only way to answer these questions was to reverse engineer the protocol itself.

## Reverse Engineering the Authentication Flow

### Initial Discovery

My first step was examining how real Pwnagotchi devices communicate with the grid. Using packet capture and API inspection, I identified the enrollment endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/unit/enroll
```

But what data format did it expect? Time to dig deeper.

### Understanding the Cryptographic Requirements

Through analysis of the open-source Pwnagotchi codebase and network traffic, I discovered the authentication uses:

1. **RSA-2048 keypairs** - Each unit needs a persistent identity
2. **SHA-256 fingerprints** - Computed from the public key
3. **PKCS1-PSS signatures** - Signs `name@fingerprint` with the private key

The server validates this signature to ensure the enrollment request comes from someone who controls the private key. This prevents impersonation attacks.

### Implementing Authentic Signing

Getting the signature format right was critical. The grid expects:

```python
def generate_signature(name: str, fingerprint: str, private_key) -> str:
    message = f"{name}@{fingerprint}".encode('utf-8')
    signature = private_key.sign(
        message,
        padding.PSS(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
            salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
        ),
        hashes.SHA256()
    )
    return base64.b64encode(signature).decode('utf-8')
```

Any deviation from this exact format and the server rejects the enrollment. This taught me how serious the authentication is - you can't fake it without the private key.

## Discovering API Endpoints Through Testing

With authentication working, I needed to understand the full API surface. Through systematic testing and endpoint discovery, I mapped out:

### Enrollment Flow
```
POST /api/v1/unit/enroll
Body: { identity, public_key, signature, data }
Returns: JWT token for subsequent requests
```

### AP Reporting
```
POST /inbox
Headers: { X-Unit-Name, X-Unit-Fingerprint, X-Unit-Signature }
Body: Access point data with encryption info
```

### Unit Data Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/unit/{fingerprint}/data
Returns: Current statistics for the unit
```

Each endpoint taught me something about the protocol design and security model.

## Stress Testing at Scale

Once I understood the protocol, I could properly stress test it. But this revealed interesting challenges:

### The Million AP Problem

What happens when a unit has 1,000,000 pwned networks? Reporting them individually would take hours. Through testing different approaches, I discovered:

- The server can handle batch uploads efficiently
- Intelligent sampling maintains statistical accuracy
- Multi-threading is essential for performance

This led to the multi-threaded architecture:

```bash
# Single-threaded: ~8 minutes
python3 pwnagotchi-gen.py --count 1 --name mega --pwned 1000000

# 20 threads: ~30 seconds
python3 pwnagotchi-gen.py --count 1 --name mega --pwned 1000000 --threads 20
```

| Pwned Count | Threads | Time     | Discovery |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 1,000,000   | 1       | ~8 min   | Connection timeout issues |
| 1,000,000   | 10      | ~60 sec  | Improved but still slow |
| 1,000,000   | 20      | ~30 sec  | Optimal performance |
| 1,000,000   | 50      | ~12 sec  | Diminishing returns |

### Rate Limiting Discovery

By gradually increasing request volume, I found the grid has soft rate limits around:
- 50 concurrent connections per IP
- ~1000 AP reports per minute per unit
- Exponential backoff on repeated failures

Understanding these limits helped design respectful testing that won't impact production grids.

## Protocol Edge Cases and Security

### Edge Case: Unicode SSIDs

Testing revealed interesting handling of non-ASCII SSIDs:

```python
# These all needed proper handling:
ssid = "cafÃ©"           # UTF-8 encoding
ssid = "æµ‹è¯•ç½‘ç»œ"        # Chinese characters  
ssid = "ðŸ”¥WiFi"         # Emoji (yes, really)
```

The grid properly handles UTF-8 encoding, but URL encoding in API calls required careful attention.

### Edge Case: Signature Replay

What happens if you reuse a signature? Testing showed:
- Signatures are time-sensitive (implicitly via JWT)
- But the enrollment signature can be cached
- Token refresh is handled gracefully

### Edge Case: Extreme Statistics

Can units report billions of epochs or impossible uptime? Testing revealed:
- The server validates reasonable ranges
- But allows for very high-uptime units
- Statistics are stored as appropriate integer types

## Building the Testing Framework

Understanding the protocol enabled building a comprehensive testing suite:

### Authentic Simulation
Every synthetic unit:
- Generates real RSA-2048 keypairs
- Computes proper SHA-256 fingerprints  
- Signs enrollment exactly like real devices
- Cannot be distinguished from genuine Pwnagotchi units

### Fleet Management
The CLI and web interface provide:
- Real-time monitoring of synthetic units
- Bulk operations (boot all, stop all)
- Per-unit Tor circuit management
- Persistent state across restarts

### Performance Testing
Multi-threading enables:
- High-volume AP reporting (millions of networks)
- Concurrent unit enrollment
- Database connection pool stress testing
- API rate limit verification

## Real-World Applications

### Security Research

Understanding the authentication protocol helps identify:
- Potential attack vectors (all mitigated by design)
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- DoS resistance under load
- Token handling security

### Protocol Documentation

This project serves as unofficial documentation for:
- Enrollment flow and requirements
- AP reporting format and validation
- Expected HTTP headers and responses
- Error handling and retry logic

### Grid Deployment Testing

Before deploying your own opwngrid:
- Test database performance under load
- Verify API server scaling
- Validate connection pooling
- Confirm rate limiting works

## Technical Deep Dive

### Authentication Internals

```python
# Key generation
private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=2048,
    backend=default_backend()
)

# Fingerprint computation
public_der = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.DER,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
)
fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(public_der).hexdigest()

# Signature generation
signature = private_key.sign(
    f"{name}@{fingerprint}".encode(),
    padding.PSS(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
    ),
    hashes.SHA256()
)
```

### AP Reporting Strategy

Intelligent sampling based on total count:

```python
def calculate_sample_size(total_pwned: int) -> int:
    if total_pwned <= 100:
        return total_pwned  # Report all
    elif total_pwned <= 1000:
        return min(500, total_pwned)  # Up to 500
    elif total_pwned <= 100000:
        return int(total_pwned * 0.01)  # 1%
    else:
        return min(5000, int(total_pwned * 0.005))  # 0.5%, max 5K
```

This maintains statistical accuracy while respecting API limits.
