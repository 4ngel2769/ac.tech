# Zero Trust Networking: A Modern Security Approach

Zero Trust is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access.

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." This approach assumes that threats exist both inside and outside of the network, so no user or device should be trusted by default.

## Key Principles

1. **Verify explicitly** - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
2. **Use least privilege access** - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA)
3. **Assume breach** - Minimize blast radius and segment access

## Implementation Strategies

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Network Segmentation**
- **Continuous Monitoring**

Zero Trust represents a paradigm shift from traditional "castle and moat" security models to a more comprehensive, dynamic approach to cybersecurity.
